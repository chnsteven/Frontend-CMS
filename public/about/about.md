- Programming languages:

  - My first programming language was **Java**. I learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming, design principles and patterns with **Java**. I created the **Java Application** project listed under the Projects above.
  - After that, I began my jorney with computer hardwares and algorithm designs. Throughout that study, I utilized **C** and **C++**. I also experimented with assembly language, and the conversion of modern languages into assembly language.
  - ML (Machine learning) and Statistics are also part of my undergraduate study. Here, **Python** and **R** are the 2 languages that I used to write ML algorithms and make Statistical inferences and visualizations.
  - Near the end of my study, I touched on software development, where I created a Full-stack project with a partner. I learned how to program in **Typescript** as I developed the project. Previously I had minimal knowledge about **Javascript**.

- Frameworks and Libraries:

  - I built foundation in Computer Graphics and Animations. I understand splines, interpolations and other principles and used **Three.js** to model animations.

- After graduation, I made several full-stack projects using **Node.js**. I looked into popular modern Frontend libraries like **Next.js** and **React.js**.

  Experience with Test-driven developments, **OOP**, **ECS**.
  Experience with version control with **git**.
  Participated in a simulated **Agile** work environment.
  Understand **design principles**, **design patterns**, **data structures** and **algorithms**.
  Understand **Intelligent** system, **computer graphics**, and **computer animations**.
  Familiar with developing React application using **React-Router**, **Bootstrap**, **API calls**.
