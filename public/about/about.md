- Programming languages:

  - My first programming language was **Java**. I learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming, design principles and patterns with **Java**. I created the **Java Application** project listed under the Projects above.
  - After that, I built solid foundation in computer hardwares and algorithm designs. I digged into low-level programming with machine code, assembly language, **C** and **C++**.
  - ML (Machine learning) and Statistics are also part of my undergraduate study. Here, **Python** and **R** are the 2 languages that I used to write ML algorithms and make Statistical inferences and visualizations.
  - Near the end of my study, I touched on software development, where I created a Full-stack project with a partner. I learned how to program in **Typescript** as I developed the project. Previously I had minimal knowledge about **Javascript**.
  - I touched on video game programming as well. In school, I followed the **Entity Component System (ECS)** Architecture to build a C++ game in a team. Outside of school, I made two personal games, where the first one was familiarizing myself with the Unity game engine and the second one was a game created in Godot 4 for the Global Game Jam 2024.

- Miscellaneous:

  - I built foundation in Computer Graphics and Animations. I understand splines, interpolations and other principles and used **Three.js** to model animations. _/about/a2%20demo.mp4_
  - After graduation, I made several full-stack projects using **Node.js**. I looked into popular modern Frontend libraries like **Next.js** and **React.js**.
  - In addition to **Node.js**, I was interested in other backend technologies, so I began learning about PHP, SQL, and built a **Content Management System (CMS)**.
  - I experimented with different kinds of relational databases including **SQlite**, **MySQL**.
  - For all the projects, I used **git** for version control.
  - I am used to participating in an **Agile** work environment. Slack was my communication application in a team setting.
