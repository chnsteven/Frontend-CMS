### **Programming Languages:**

- My first programming language was **Java**, where I learned the basics of Object-Oriented Programming, design principles, and patterns. I created the **Java Application** project listed above under Projects.
- After that, I built a solid foundation in computer hardware and algorithm design, diving into low-level programming with machine code, assembly language, **C**, and **C++**.
- During my undergraduate studies, I also explored **Machine Learning (ML)** and Statistics. I used **Python** and **R** to write ML algorithms and perform statistical analysis and visualizations.
- Toward the end of my studies, I ventured into software development by working on a Full-stack project with a partner. This is where I learned **Typescript**, having previously had only basic knowledge of **JavaScript**.
- I also dabbled in video game programming. At school, I followed the **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture to build a **C++** game with a team. Outside of school, I created two personal gamesâ€”one in **Unity** and another in **Godot 4** for the Global Game Jam 2024.

### **Miscellaneous:**

- I gained a foundation in **Computer Graphics and Animation**, understanding splines, interpolations, and other principles. I used **Three.js** to model animations.

- After graduating, I built several full-stack projects using **Node.js** and explored popular frontend libraries like **Next.js** and **React.js**.
- Beyond **Node.js**, I became interested in other backend technologies, learning **PHP** and **SQL** to build a **Content Management System (CMS)**.
- I experimented with various relational databases, including **SQLite** and **MySQL**.
- For all my projects, I used **Git** for version control.
- I'm familiar with working in an **Agile** environment, and I've used **Slack** for team communication.
