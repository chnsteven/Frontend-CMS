## Overview

In a team of 6, we completed a 10-minute adventure game in 3 months, written in C++.

Our implementation follows the Entity Component System (ECS) architectural pattern.

Most implementations are written by ourselves, except for visual assets like JSON map generator, enemy sprite sheets and etc.

## Features

- Implemented **text** and **shadow rendering** using OpenGL.
- Developed a **Physics system** and a **particle system**.
- Documented progress and conducted **code reviews** on a weekly basis.
- Designed **character assets** using drawing tools.
- Implemented enemy logic with **A\* search algorithm** and **behavior trees**.
