Jank Bot is an early prototype android for a development project focused on creating the perfect companion for humans. The project has little funding, but has made tremendous progress on their humanoid design. By salvaging from previous models and refurbished parts they have managed to create the most sophisticated iteration of the Companion Bot android to date. At this stage in development we are ready to begin testing its capabilities in controlled environments.

As the latest prototype test subject, you will be tasked with engaging in a painting activity to assess precision, coordination and control. Paint the picture as accurately as possible and be graded on your performance. Failure to provide optimal results will lead to termination.

## Overview

Jank Bot is a 3D physics simulator where players take on the role of a malfunctioning robot undergoing a series of skill-based challenges. In this exercise, you are tasked with filling in the image displayed on a canvas with the colors provided on the table. You will be judged for accuracy. The scientist will gradually become frustrated if you knock too many objects off the table or take too long.

We recommend playing Jank Bot with a controller.
