## Overview

Utilized modern web technologies such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to develop a robust backend server and a frontend webpage.

## Features

- Applied **Express** for routing parsed front-matter through **gray-matter** from Markdown files and image data, creating RESTful API endpoints on the server side. Ensured secure access to these endpoints by integrating Cors for controlled access management.
- Utilized **Axios** for making HTTP requests to retrieve data from the backend server, facilitating dynamic content rendering and enhancing user engagement.
- Incorporated **UI/UX** design principles to develop interactive features such as font-resizing and dynamic UI element animations. Enhanced the overall user experience by ensuring **responsive design** compatibility across various devices and screen sizes with the help of **Bootstrap** and **CSS**.
